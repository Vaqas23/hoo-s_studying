Hoo's Studying

- Fun side project by UVA undergraduate Vaqas Q. 
- Learned python recently and trying to learn my first web framework (Django)
- First ever time using GitHub
- Wanted to get right into the mess, learn by doing, trial and error

Tech Stack

- Python 3.14.0
- Django 6.0
- SQLite 3.51.0

Update: 2/5/26

- Learned a lot: forms, models, http, urls, html, views, tests, etc.
- Built out foundational backend
- Will return to project later (likely Fall 2026), want to explore other fields like C and ML.
